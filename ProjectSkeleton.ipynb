    "Our project topic is building a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). A GAN is a machine learning framework introduced by Ian Goodfellow in 2014. The purpose of a GAN is to generate data that follows a similar statistical distribution to the provided training data. GANs are very powerful, because they can mimic any distribution of data. For our project we are generating images based on the Stanford Dog Dataset. A GAN is made up of two neural network models: A generator and a discriminator. The generator creates images, and the discriminator classifies a provided image as “real” or generated. These two models are “adversaries” pitted against each other in training. \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of our project is to code a GAN and use it to generate images of dogs. In doing so, we hope to learn about the training techniques used to build a GAN and overcome the training challenges of two networks competing with each other. "

    "We are using the [Stanford Dog Dataset](http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/). It includes NUM colored images of NUM breeds of dogs. The images are in .jpg format, but we also use a provided .mat file to more easily load the data into a pandas dataframe. We use the Keras preprocessing and Pillow libraries to load the .jpg images into an array format that can be used as input for a neural network model. "
